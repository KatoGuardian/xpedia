1. Copy this to the root directory of the game.

2. If you have Node.js installed, regardless of OS, run "node xpedia.js". Otherwise, if you are using Windows, run "xpedia.bat".
It will construct and open xpedia.html. 
"node xpedia.js" option makes more compact file, is cross platform and is more flexible (for example, allows you to change intro text).

Or if you already has up-to-date xpedia.html you can just open it directly.

If mod is *not* XPiratez or language is not English, edit xpedia.bat (or xpedia.js) to change mod's name.
